## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

This library deals with eSIM provisioning — activation codes and SM-DP+ addresses may be sensitive in certain
deployments. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately so it can be addressed before public
disclosure.

### How to report

Use **[GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/DanielMarkiel/expo-esim-provisioning/security/advisories/new)** to
submit a private report. This keeps the details confidential until a fix is released.

Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept
- Affected versions
- Any suggested mitigations (optional but appreciated)

### Response timeline

- **Acknowledgement:** within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment:** within 7 days
- **Fix / disclosure:** coordinated with the reporter — typically within 30 days depending on severity

Thank you for helping keep expo-esim-provisioning and its users safe.
